object: to get yourself from the bottom-left corner to the
top-right corner of the board as quickly and with as
few walks as possible. Instead of using arrow keys, though,
you have to write code to walk.

You have different kinds of commands available.

You can:
	Move one space in any direction.
		Ex: move right
	Move only if it's possible.
		Ex: if can move up, move up
	Move for as long as possible
		Ex: while can move down, move down
	Move for a certain amount of steps
		Ex: for 6 steps, move down


You can string together a lot of paths into one walk
so that you take fewer walks.
For example: for 6 steps, move up. if can move left, move left.
But be careful! If you try to move off the path by going too
far, it will count an extra walk against you! Finish with as few
walks as possible!

Also don't forget to write the code correctly. After you
put your commands in loops and if-statements, you have to
put one closing brace for each if-statement, while-loop,
and for-loop. To put a closing brace, click "end".
